## **Briefly About Myself:**

Throughout my life I have always been interested in computer technologies and their possibilities. I often helped my friends and acquaintances solve problems related to their devices.

Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to get an education related to IT technologies and I worked as a teacher at a school.
For a couple of years I was thinking about changing my field of activity and I got interested in Frontend development.
Now I left my previous job and began to study independently in the IT field.

I hope that my skills as a teacher will be useful on my way, and with my perseverance and desire, I will be able to achieve good results both on my own and with the help of a friendly community of programmers and in the future I will be able to become a full-fledged Frontend-developer.
